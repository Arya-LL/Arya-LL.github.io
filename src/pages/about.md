Hi, my name is Arya Lyngdoh Lakshmanan. I am a graduate student at NYU's [scientific computing program](https://math.nyu.edu/dynamic/graduate/ms-gsas/ms-scientific-computing/), and this is my personal website where I host a collection of my various projects. My projects are typically endeavors in data analytics, forecasting/modelling, and machine learning.
You can also see some of these projects on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Arya-LL).

If you enjoy any of what I've done or you want to contact me, please get in touch through [email](mailto:arya.l.lakshmanan@gmail.com).

## Tools I Use

I mostly use Python for my projects because of its general-purpose data science and machine learning libraries. Aside from Python, I have thorough experience in JavaScript/Node.js from commercial projects and Rust from personal projects.

### Miscellaneous tools
- PostreSQL to interact with databases
- R for statistical analysis and data visualization
- PyTorch, NumPy, and pandas for machine learning/data science in Python
- Conda for Python management
- Jupyter for Python notebooking
- Fedora/Arch Linux
- LaTeX for papers/articles
