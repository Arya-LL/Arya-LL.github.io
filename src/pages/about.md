Hi, my name is Arya Lyngdoh Lakshmanan. This website is a collection of my various projects, and possibly blog posts written just for the site. My projects are typically endeavors in data analytics, web development, and machine learning. My biggest current project for example is a home grown implementation of user-tailored neural network to create and maintain spotify playlists.
Most of my projects are open source and hosted on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Arya-LL).

If you enjoy any of what I've done or you want to contact me, please get in touch through [email](mailto:arya.l.lakshmanan@gmail.com).

## Tech Stack

Most of my work is done in Rust, which I learned through reading the incredible [rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). I am aiming to use Rust as my primary language for all of my projects so I can gain experience with the language and learn through doing.

I also work extensively in Python and R, as I have the most past experience in data analytics with them, especially in the realms of academic analysis and finance/economics.

For data management, I use PostgreSQL and am learning alternative databases like SurrealDB.

Lastly, for project management, I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) to organize my thoughts and develop high level goals.
