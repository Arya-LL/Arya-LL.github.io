# Work Experience

## AI and LLM Consultant / WordsworthTech Inc
Dec 2023 – Apr 2024, May 2025 – Aug 2025
- Architected a Node.js API to orchestrate low-latency interactions between the StreamAlive platform and LLMs (Gemini/OpenAI), optimizing for high-concurrency live session environments
- Developed custom parsing logic and validation layers to handle stochastic LLM outputs, ensuring strict type-safety and reliability for downstream application logic
- Established quantitative metrics to monitor token usage and response quality, implementing caching and prompt-tuning strategies that reduced operational costs while maintaining model performance

## Undergraduate Research Assistant / Rutgers University
Aug 2021 – May 2023
- Researched the effect of frequent supernovae on the dark matter within dwarf galaxies under Dr. Kristen McQuinn (NASA Roman Space Telescope Mission Head)
- Developed regression models in Python to estimate dark matter distributions in dwarf galaxies
- Engineered automated testing routines for galaxy simulations, reducing computation time and minimizing error margins in large-scale dataset analysis

# Projects

## Multi-GPU Performance Analytical Model | CUDA, C++, Python
Sep 2025 – Dec 2025

- Quantified compute vs communication tradeoffs to identify scaling limits under PCIe constraints, informing when multi-GPU parallelism degraded performance
- Implemented micro-benchmarks in CUDA to calibrate hardware parameters (PCIe throughput, FLOPs) on arbitrary Nvidia architectures
- Validated the model against bottlenecked algorithms (N-Body, Conjugate Gradient), successfully identifying hardware saturation points and scaling limits

## Rust/CUDA Simulation Engine | Rust, wgpu, CUDA
Sep 2025 – Present
- Re-engineered a solar system simulation engine in Rust, migrating from my prior JavaScript WebGL/GLSL implementation to a Rust WebGPU API 
- Accelerated procedural texture generation by implementing a specialized version of Perlin Noise in CUDA

## Rust-Based Deep Learning Audio Classifier | Rust, Burn
Aug 2024 – Present
- Engineered an asynchronous, multi-threaded deep learning pipeline in Rust using the Burn framework to classify audio features with Transformer-based attention mechanisms
- Implemented a classification batcher with dynamic padding masks to efficiently process variable-length sequential data, optimizing memory usage during inference

# Societies and Extracurriculars

## President and Treasurer / Rutgers Astronomical Society
Sep 2021 – May 2023

- Managed budget and led weekly public seminars for 100+ attendees; served as department liaison for university events.
- Created and maintained an LGBTQ+ safe space in collaboration with Rutgers minority advocacy groups.
