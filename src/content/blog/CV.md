# Overview

After studying both Astrophysics and Economics at Rutgers University, where I also picked up a bit of financial economics and math, I've found myself happily at the crossroads of software development, finance, and data science. It's been a journey filled with unique experiences, from leading the Rutgers Astronomical Society to diving deep into research about the mysteries of dark matter distribution—a journey that even led to me being honored with the Henry Rutgers Scholar Award.

Lately, I've been venturing into the world of AI and Large Language Models, consulting to create smarter, more cost-effective solutions. I've been getting my hands dirty with Python, NodeJS, SQL, and Docker, and I've even started piecing together a multi-headed attention neural network to better organize Spotify playlists. Beyond just the technical stuff, I'm passionate about making STEM education more accessible and engaging, and I'm always on the lookout for new challenges that push my analytical thinking, tech skills, and to feed my love for solving problems in creative ways.
