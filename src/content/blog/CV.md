# Table of Contents
# Overview

I am currently a graduate student in the scientific computing program at NYU, and I completed my undergraduate degree in astrophysics and financial economics at Rutgers University. In recent work, I developed an AI/LLM backend for StreamAlive using Node.js, researched the impact of supernovae on dark matter distributions using Python, tutored SAT math and science, and assisted in teaching a set theory course. Outside both schooling and work, I led the Rutgers Astronomical Society (RAS) for two years, taught myself Rust, Linux administration, and SQL. As hobbies, I enjoy long distance running, board games, and crocheting.

# Experience

## AI and Large Language Model Consultant - Dec 2023 to April 2024
As an AI and LLM Consultant, I proposed and developed the integration of generative AI into WordsworthTech's [StreamAlive](https://www.streamalive.com/) product, focusing on enhancing functionality while managing costs effectively. 
- **Core API Development:** I developed a NodeJS API to seamlessly integrate cost-efficient Gemini and GPT models into the existing development stack. Due to the non-deterministic nature of LLM outputs, I additionally developed validation techniques and custom parsers for the AI responses. I self-taught Node.js through this project.
- **Plugin & Tool Expansion:** To broaden the API's utility, I created custom Stream Deck and Google Slides plugins. These tools provided users with direct access to the generative AI capabilities within their existing workflows.
- **Performance & Strategy:** I established quantitative metrics to monitor and analyze the quality and cost-effectiveness of the AI models. I delivered weekly reports and strategic recommendations to senior developers, guiding decisions on model tuning, cost optimization, and future AI product pipeline expansions.
## Undergraduate Research Project - Sep 2021 to May 2023

I researched the impact that time-periods with heightened star deaths/bursts have on the dark matter distributions within nearby dwarf galaxies. In practice, I was given data sources for which I developed my own cleaning methods, analysis, modelling, and error estimation using Python. I led this project with the guidance of Dr. Kristen McQuinn to integrate into a larger (unpublished as of May 2025) investigation, and I presented my findings through my senior thesis.
- **Data Validation:** I gathered archival images from the Spitzer and Hubble space telescopes, and I developed data cleaning Python scripts to identify and interpolate over contaminants. I validated the cleaning process by sampling and analyzing the data distributions over the interpolated regions.
- **Data Analysis and Modeling:** I created best-fit models using Python to represent the data accurately. I analyzed the impact of varying my chosen initial guesses/hyper-parameters on the resulting models and ensured that the models were stable.
- **Outcomes:** The project culminated in a comprehensive written thesis and oral presentation. I was given several awards for my work and presentation of this project. Most notably, I received the  [[#Henry Rutgers Scholar Award - May 2023|Henry Rutgers Scholar Award]] and  [[#Highest Honors in Astrophysics - May 2023|Highest Honors in Astrophysics]] for this work.
## Learning Assistant - Sep 2021 to May 2023

Taught and mentored over 80 undergraduate students in an upper-level course focused on formal-based logic and set theory. Developed and tailored teaching materials and exercises to meet diverse student group needs. Enhanced students' analytical skills and effectively communicated complex mathematical concepts.

## Unmetric Marketing Intern - Jul 2018 to Aug 2018

Analyzed an 8,000-lead dataset using advanced Excel to refine the marketing funnel. Presented findings and strategic suggestions to the marketing team.
# Organizations

## Rutgers Astronomical Society Treasurer and President - May 2021 to May 2023

I led the [Rutgers Astronomical Society (RAS)](https://ras.physics.rutgers.edu/) - which is one of the most active student organizations at Rutgers, and whose goal is astronomy outreach and education. As treasurer and president, I greatly increased student membership and engagement, created an astrophotography program, and initiated collaborative projects with other student organizations.
- **Leadership:** I orchestrated weekly public observing nights and astronomy seminars, consistently drawing an average of 100 attendees. I drastically increased student engagement by creating and managing more activities and roles for members to participate and volunteer.
- **Initiatives and Expansion:** I created and organized two annual special projects - a state park trip for naked-eye nighttime observing and a joint engineering/physics outreach night with two other undergraduate societies. I additionally founded and sourced equipment for two new routine activities - astrophotography lessons and fundraising through selling merchandise. All of these initiatives are still in effect as of May 2025 and directly led to a growth in visitors, members, and engagement.
- **Public Speaking & Representation:** For our weekly meetings, I frequently delivered presentations on complex topics like classical astronomy, dark matter, and cosmology to audiences composed by everyone from elementary school students  to astronomy professors. I additionally spoke as the undergraduate representative of the astronomy department at special events, such as a science festival at Bell Labs, a yearly department banquet, and other university-wide events.
- **Community and Inclusivity:** I created and solidified RAS's position as an inclusive organization through collaboration with minority advocacy groups.

## E-Sports Club Founder - Sep 2018 to May 2019

I founded & managed the E-Sports club during senior year of high school, resulting in 100+ members in less than 5 months. In my time there, I organized teams within the club, negotiated for room and technology from the school, and continuously drove recruitment efforts.

## High School Tennis Captain - Sep 2018 to May 2019

I founded & managed the E-Sports club during senior year of high school, resulting in 100+ members in less than 5 months. In my time there, I organized teams within the club, negotiated for room and technology from the school, and continuously drove recruitment efforts.
